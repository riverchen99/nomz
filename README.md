CS130 Project

To run locally, you need a config/keys.js file. We commit it here for convenience (in practice, we should not track this file in version control).   
Start backend with "npm run server" from root.  
Start frontend with "npm start" from /client.  
Lint/run tests with "npm run test" from root.  
Generate documentation with "npm run docs" form root.
